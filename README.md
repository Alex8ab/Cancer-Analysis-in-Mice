The Power of Plots

**The final report will include the following below:**

- A summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen

- Bar plots that show the number of data points for each treatment regimen using Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot

- A box plot of the final tumor volume for the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin; and highlighting any potential outliers in the plot. Additionally, display the calculation of the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.

- A line plot of time point versus tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin

- A scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen. Additionally, show the calculation of the correlation coefficient and linear regression model and plot this linear regression model on top of the scatter plot.
